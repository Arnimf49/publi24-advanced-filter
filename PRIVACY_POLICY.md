This is the privacy policy for the `Publi24 advanced filter` browser extension.

The extension **does not** access, use, collect or send any of your personal information. While the
extension runs on both Google, Publi24 and Nimfomane websites, even if you are authenticated on these websites, 
no access happens to your information.

The extension exclusively operates on the public information that is found on the Google, Publi24 and Nimfomane website.

- Operating system and browser user agent.

This data is:

- Collected only once per user.
